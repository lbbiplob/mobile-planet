              How does prototypical inheritance work?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Prototype inheritance in javascript is the linking of prototypes
              of a parent object to a child object to share and utilize the
              properties of a parent class using a child class. Prototypes are
              hidden objects that are used to share the properties and methods
              of a parent class to child classes.

              What are the different ways to manage a state in a React
              application?
            </h3>
            <p>
              There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in
              your React apps: Local state, Global state, Server state, URL
              state,

            <p>
              React is a UI library, Angular is a fully-fledged front-end
              framework, while Vue.js is a progressive framework. They can be
              used almost interchangeably to build front-end applications, but
              theyâ€™re not 100 percent the same

              What is a unit test? Why should we write unit tests?
            </h3>
            <p>
              A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of
              code that can be logically isolated in a system.The main objective
              of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and determine
              if it works as intended
